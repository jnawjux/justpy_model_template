## JustPy DS Templates
---
These are basic templates for making a quick interactive webpage with `justpy` for machine learning projects. The models used are not the emphasis, the focus here is showing the ease of going from a pickled model to an interactive tool in just one file. 

`spam_bot.py` is a single page with text area for a live updating spam detecting of text. 

`titanic.py` is a single page with multiple field options to return the likelyhood of a persons survival on the Titanic.
